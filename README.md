# LSH and SimHash

Learning Locality Sensitive Hashing, SimHash, and other stuff to get better at C and lower level programming in general. 
Tokenizer works!!!
Usage after compilation: `"name_of_compiled_file" file_to_tokenize.txt "reserved_token_1,reserved_token_2..." `
Outputs json. 
Likely a bug somewhere
